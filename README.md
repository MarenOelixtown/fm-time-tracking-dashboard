### Links

- Live Site URL: [Time tracking dashboard / Vercel-deployment](https://fm-time-tracking-dashboard-mu.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The content of the activity-section was retrieved from a separate data-file. This part is built up with JavaScript by using the document.createElement method and by using template literals the content of each activity is created dynamically.

### Continued development

The attached links gave me orientation and ideas for combining buttons and timframe-tabs to address accessibility issues. There is more to discover in this regard for the future.

### Useful resources

- [ARIA: tab role ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role) - This helped me with accessibility.
- [Example Tab Group](https://www.atomica11y.com/accessible-web/tabs/) - This helped me with accessibility.
